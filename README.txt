Salman Syed Assignment 3 - README

You will need eclipse 2023 and JDK 11.0.18. That is what I used to run it, other versions newer than that may work.

Overall the same requirements as the assingment gives to open. Only difference is that there are working test cases.
To view them, they are under commons-email-1.3.2-src\src\test\java\org\apache\commons\mail. 
Under that location there is EmailConcrete.java and EmailTest.java. In order to check the test coverage,
right click the commons-email and hover Coverage As and click 2 JUnit Test and the tests for the 10 assigned methods should appear. Only two of the assigned are below 70%. The rest should be above 70%.
